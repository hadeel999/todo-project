#### What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
I don't have questions, I was just confused about something that I did in the part of static form for users. 
Because I depended on a website called "Formspree" to solve this part. I found it while I was searching.
#### How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took me around four hours, because I also was having some installation issues since my laptop has been fixed just today. In fact, I did'nt think about this when I started to solve it.
